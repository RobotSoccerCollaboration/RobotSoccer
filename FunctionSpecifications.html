<p>This document defines the features and specifications of our soccer-playing robots. It also analyzes customer needs and how well the product meets these needs. This document serves as an outline for our product, and will be updated as new information becomes available.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h4>

<p>Robot Soccer is an international phenomenon, with elite teams from all over the world gather to pit technique, strategy, and brawn against each other to earn victory on the soccer field. There are currently two international organizations that regulate robot soccer competitions: The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_International_Robot-soccer_Association">Federation of International Robot-soccer Association</a> (FIRA) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCup">RoboCup</a>. Both of these organizations were founded in 1997 and have continued to gain international popularity.</p>

<p>Brigham Young University also hosts a robot soccer competition. Our robot soccer project is designed to be a dominant and competitive team in our BYU competition.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-product-description" class="anchor" href="#product-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Product Description</h4>

<p>Robot soccer requires true system-level design. Our team must integrate a wireless communication system, computer vision, feedback control, real-time programming, artificial intelligence, and mechanical design. Second, the overall project is much too ambitious for a single student, so teamwork is essential.</p>

<p>The overall layout of the project is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p><img src="/RobotSoccer/images/block-diagram.jpg"></p>

<p>The robots will be competing 2 vs. 2 on small, walled soccer field. An overhead camera will provide images to each team's base computer to allow algorithms to compute the location and orientation of the four robots and the ball. This information will then be streamed via wireless communication to the individual robots, who posess the artificial intelligence to analyze the data and make a competitive play.</p>

<p>Our project is to design the robot system, as well as the image processing software. These robots will be completely autonomous and will require no human interaction after being activated and placed on the playing field. The scope of our project will involve mechanical design, computer vision, motion control systems, artificial intelligence, and system architecture. Most importantly, all of these systems will work seamlessly together while following the pre-programmed game rules.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-project-requirements" class="anchor" href="#project-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Requirements</h3>

<p>Our project will need to meet requirements specified by both the BYU robot soccer competition and our customers. To design the best product possible, we gathered input from our customers and studied the competition rules. Our customers have provided several different contraints. Some are more important to the success of the project than others. Furthermore, some would require more resources than we have available for this project in our current timeframe. </p>

<p>Our product cannot compromise in meeting game rules. Consequently, meeting all of the rule contraints are top priority. We then analyzed the customer requirements and prioritized them based on their importance to the success of the project.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-mission-statement" class="anchor" href="#mission-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission Statement</h4>

<p>Our mission is to create a fully autonomous robot that through superior hardware and software design is capable of playing within specified game rules and outperforming the competition.</p>

<h4>
<a id="user-content-game-rules" class="anchor" href="#game-rules" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Game Rules</h4>

<p>One set of requirements come directly from the rules of the BYU robot soccer competition:  </p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Robots must fit within a cylinder of 8-inch diameter and 10-inch height</li>
<li>The ball is a standard golf ball, the color will be determined by majority vote.</li>
<li>The playing field is 5 feet wide by 10 feet long. The sides of the field are angled so that a ball cannot get stuck against the sides or corners.</li>
<li>Goals will be 2 feet wide.</li>
<li>Robots must be designed in a way that will not damage other robots, the playing field, or human spectators.

<ul class="task-list">
<li>Kickers are not allowed to shoot the ball hard enough to damage other players.</li>
<li>Robots must avoid collisions.</li>
<li>Any contact with a defender while in the defense area will be a violation</li>
<li>Outside the defense area, contact that noticeably changes a player's orientation, position, or motion will be a violation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We will not observe the traditional offsides rule.</li>
<li>Robots cannot drop parts on the field</li>
<li>Robots are not allowed to fix the ball to their frame or encompass the ball in any way that prevents access by other players.</li>
</ul>

<p>The table below specifies our customers requirements. We have ranked them by priority. </p>

<p>Priority: 1 = Very High, 2 = High, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Low</p>
